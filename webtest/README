To run the WebTest functional tests, cd into this directory and run "ant" - the default build.xml target will create a test Grails application, install the plugin into it, run the scripts to create Role and User classes, etc.

You'll need to create a file named build.properties with three properties, 'testproject', 'version.plugin', and 'version.webtest', e.g.

   testproject=AcegiTestApp
	version.plugin=0.3-20080422-SNAPSHOT
	version.webtest=0.4

- 'testproject' is the name of the Grails test application. Make sure there's not already a project with that name in your workspace since it will be deleted and replaced.
- 'version.plugin' is the version of the Acegi plugin (the same value as the 'version' variable in AcegiGrailsPlugin.groovy)
- 'version.webtest' is the version of the bundled WebTest plugin (currently 0.4).

Once you've created build.properties, run "ant" and it will create the test application and artifacts and copy tests and other resources.

cd into the project's directory and run 'grails run-webtest' to execute the tests. On Windows a browser will open with the HTML report when the tests are finished, on another OS you'll need to manually open webtest/reports/WebTestResults.html.

Note that after the tests are finished, the application can be run using 'grails run-app' for manual testing.
