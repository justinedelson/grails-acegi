To run the functional tests, cd into this directory and use build.xml to create a test Grails application, install the plugin into it, run the scripts to create Role and User classes, etc.

You'll need to create a file named build.properties these properties:

   testproject104=AcegiTestApp104
   testproject111=AcegiTestApp111
   testproject120=AcegiTestApp120
   version.plugin=0.6
   version.webtest=0.5.1

- 'testprojectXXX' are the names of the Grails test applications. Make sure there's not already a project with that name in your workspace since it will be deleted and replaced.
- 'version.plugin' is the version of the Acegi plugin (the same value as the 'version' variable in AcegiGrailsPlugin.groovy)
- 'version.webtest' is the version of the bundled WebTest plugin (currently 0.5.1).

Once you've created build.properties, run 'ant create-test-project-104', 'ant create-test-project-111', or 'ant create-test-project-120' to create a test application and artifacts and copy tests and other resources.

cd into the project's directory and run one of the test targets to execute the tests:

	ant test-static
	ant test-requestmap
	ant test-annotation
	ant test-basic
	ant test-register

Note that after the tests are finished, the application can be run using 'grails run-app' for manual testing.
